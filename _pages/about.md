**Purpose of this blog:** Blogs written here are intended to share some particulars that I came across or felt the need for, sometimes new topics or approaches to understanding something. Occasionally, non-technical blogs will be included too.

**About me:** I'm currently working as a senior consultant for a global OEM. I'm involved in Automotive and IoT Ecosystems Security research with a passion for enhancing the security landscape of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). I actively contribute to open-source communities as part of the organizing team for the Seasides conference and ASRG (Vulnerability Management and SOS conference) communities, focusing on fortifying vehicle security and mentoring individuals interested in Cyber Security. In simple terms, I enjoy focusing on breaking and securing things.

**Education:** In contrast, I studied Mechanical Engineering and possess a bachelor's degree in the same.

**Open Source:** I try to contribute to communities whenever I can. I'm a proud volunteer at:
