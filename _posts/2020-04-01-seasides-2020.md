#### Seasides Here we go

OWASP Seasides, Undoubtedly one of the most awaited conferences for me and this time I had again experienced marvelous stuffs while managing, training and relishing. Do feel free to go through the blog to share my happiness.


#### Day1 of meeting new family members

First Day morning of the three-day-long conference we all got energized by looking at the crowd who came to attend the conference with love. We started giving them ID’s and walked them for Diya lighting.

So, this year I had been both a Speaker and Volunteer. but, to be frank I am a family member of the seasides. it began traditionally by lighting the Diya which signifies purity, goodness, good luck and power.

On the first day of the conference, I was assigned to help at ICS village piloted by Arun Mane who was the Founder and Director of amynasec. Who also Sponsored the event, in the village, he briefed and explained to us about various aspects of ICS security such as its architecture, PLC’s and Communication protocols. things which I concluded from ICS village is ICS systems need urgent attention after all security was not given much priority while these systems were being developed. Also, due to high risk and lack of exposure, maintaining and providing security to these systems is of prime importance and poses a big challenge.


We also had discussions on conducting the most awaited Soldering village internally and so excited to give away the hardware swag from Hackaday and Tindie. the same night we had a party at the venue itself which crushed all the frost and bonded members of the team, Even though some of us met others for the first time after the party we all are a family. 

#### Day 2 of taking more responsibilities 

The second day, I had the opportunity of handling Soldering village along with Arif. we got so much of love for the soldering village, the commitment of people to learn Soldering hands-on with the help of hardware swag from Hackaday and Tindie outnumbered our hard work and efforts.

To co-op with workshops and villages, within a few minutes of kickstart, many of the members of the family joined the soldering village to help out attendees at that point I felt like we are slashing through the jungle with a motto to give our best. 

we are so glad to see our Sponsor Akash Ashokan & Dheeraj Nair from DashaGriiva Infotech at Soldering village, their interest in participating soldering village made us feel so happy.

Ohh Yeah, The marvelous badge swag is from Hackerwares by Abhinav Pandagle, he helped us a lot in conducting the Soldering Village by providing his exclusive badges, which he designed for CODE_BLUE conference. Also, he brought a lot of Badge Swag for us.

#### Day 3 delivering the workshop

The third day, In these joyous times of Volunteering, My day has come where I need to be a Speaker for the workshop which I conducted along with my friend Rahul, which is Arduino Training 101 the main motto of this workshop is to add a Robotics and IoT development flavor to the hacker’s plate.

During the workshop, we briefed about the hardware and IDE and taught them according to different perspectives such as controlling Actuator referencing sensors and controlling Arduino & Node-MCU over the internet.

We are so cheerful to see the enthusiasm in the workshop attendees towards learning about building small scale IoT based products using Arduino and Node-MCU. Speacial thanks to Prashnt KV sir for all the support and guidance.

Seedon DSouza form QtPi Robotics thought of setting up an ML experience for attendees. A day before the conference I teamed up with him along with Parag Dave for giving it a shot and we made it happen.

We took an NVIDIA Jetson Nano running ML on 128 Cuda cores with capabilities of identifying more than 9000 common day to day objects in real-time. I came to know that the NVIDIA Jetson series are used for Machine Vision and Machine Hearing, Applications like Self- Driving Cars.

Seedon’s Hardware hacking village was loved by all, where he gave live demonstrations on Wifi Deauth and Bad USB. Well. I couldn’t attend while the conference is happening and happened to get lessons from him privately.

This limitless joy dates back 8 months ago when Prashant KV and Parveen Yadav started shaping and lead us in every step which resulted in Seasides 2020.



I felt so connected with the conference team I call most of them with relation and overall it is my Habibi. I am so thankful to Prashant_KV, Parveen_Yadav, Vandana_Verma, Seasides Family members and all the participants for making it our Day with all the love and support. A big thanks to beloved Sponsors Without them it will be So hard to make it happen. 

#### Ab maja ayehga na bhidu
At the end We had a Memorable Party at the beach which became the trigger point of the conference.

Overall Seasides is the perfect & lovely place for Meeting Infosec Legends and making new friends, Networking, having a discussion of your ideas with others and getting great exposure to the community. I Can only Wait for Next year’s edition of **Habibi**
